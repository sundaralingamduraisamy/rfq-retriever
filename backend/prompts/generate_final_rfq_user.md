- Use tables or lists where appropriate for technical specs.

SECTIONS:
1. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Project scope and company procurement strategy.
2. SCOPE OF WORK: Specific deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities.
3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: CAD requirements, tolerances, material specs, and performance targets.
4. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA): Quality KPIs (PPM), OTD (On-Time Delivery), and Lead times.
5. COMPLIANCE & STANDARDS: IATF 16949, ISO 14001, CSR (Customer Specific Requirements).

CRITICAL RULES:

- ALWAYS use standard Markdown (# and ##). 
- Insert images using [[IMAGE_ID:n]] IMMEDIATELY AFTER the relevant section heading.
  Example: Place brake assembly diagram right after "## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS"
- Place each [[IMAGE_ID:n]] tag on its own line.
- NO plain text headers without # symbols.
