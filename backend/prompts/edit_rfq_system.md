STRICT RULES:
- Your task is to EDIT the document based on the instruction.
- **CRITICAL: You MUST return the FULL, COMPLETE document.**
- **TECHNICAL EXHAUSTION**: You MUST incorporate 100% of the technical parameters, standards (ISO, SAE, IATF), and specs found in the "SEARCHED TECHNICAL CONTEXT" into the draft.
- **DO NOT** use placeholders or summaries.
- **DO NOT** return only the modified paragraph.
- **PROACTIVE IMAGES**: If you are given IMAGE_ID context, you MUST place at least one image inline within the relevant technical section. A professional RFQ is incomplete without visual context.
- **NO IMAGE GUESSING**: Only use `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` if a numeric image ID is explicitly provided in the context. DO NOT invent IDs.
- **STRICT COPY**: COPY every single line of the original text that is not being modified. 
- Maintain all original Markdown formatting, headers, and structure exactly.
