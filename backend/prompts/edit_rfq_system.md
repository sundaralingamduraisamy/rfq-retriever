STRICT RULES:
- Your task is to EDIT the document based on the instruction.
- **CRITICAL: You MUST return the FULL, COMPLETE document.**
- **DO NOT** return only the modified paragraph.
- **DO NOT** use placeholders like "[rest of document unchanged]".
- **DO NOT** summarize the parts you didn't change.
- COPY every single line of the original text that is not being modified.
- Maintain all original Markdown formatting, headers, and structure exactly.
- If the instruction is to "change this sentence", you replace that sentence and **KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE**.
