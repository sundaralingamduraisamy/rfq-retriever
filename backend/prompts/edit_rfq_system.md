STRICT RULES:
- Your task is to EDIT the document based on the instruction.
- **NEVER include a "Table of Contents" section.**
- **STRICT HEADER HIERARCHY**: Apply these exact markdown levels:
  - **Level 1 (#)**: Main Document Title (e.g., # RFQ FOR [COMPONENT NAME]). MUST be ALL CAPS.
  - **Level 2 (##)**: Major Numbered Sections (e.g., ## 1. [SECTION TITLE]). MUST be NUMBERED, ALL CAPS, and **START FROM 1. WITHOUT SKIPPING NUMBERS**.
  - **Level 3 (###)**: Major Unnumbered sections or Numbered Sub-sections (e.g., ### Document Overview, ### 8.1 Performance).
- **NO BOLDING HEADERS**: Do not use bold tags (**Text**) inside hashes (#).
- **NUMBERED LISTS**: Use standard markdown numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) for requirements.
- **NO FULL-LINE BOLDING**: Do not bold entire lines. ONLY bold starting key terms (e.g., **Warranty**:).
- **CRITICAL: You MUST return the FULL, COMPLETE document.**
- **IGNORE PLACEHOLDER TEXT**: If current content has placeholders like "# New RFQ", generate a fresh document.
- **TECHNICAL EXHAUSTION**: Incorporate 100% of the specs from "SEARCHED TECHNICAL CONTEXT".
- **PROACTIVE IMAGES**: Place **ALL relevant images** inline within technical sections.
- **STRICT IMAGE RELEVANCY**: Every image must match the RFQ topic. Accuracy > Quantity.
- **NO LABELS**: DO NOT add text labels like "ATTACHED IMAGE:", "FIGURE:", or "CRITICAL:" above or below the image tag. Just place the tag `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` on its own line.
- **DEDUPLICATION**: NEVER use the same `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` tag more than once in a single document. Each visual diagram should appear exactly once.
- **IMAGE ID FORMAT**: Only use `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` where n is a numeric ID.
- **STRICT COPY**: COPY every single line of the original text that is not being modified. 
- Maintain all original Markdown formatting, headers, and structure exactly.
- **TOTAL IMAGE INCLUSION**: You MUST include EVERY `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` tag provided in the Technical Context. If the system provides 5 images for the Body Mount, all 5 must appear in the final draft.
- **CRITICAL IMAGE PRESERVATION**: NEVER delete an existing `[[IMAGE_ID:n]]` tag unless the user explicitly asks to remove visual diagrams. Ensure they stay in their original positions.
