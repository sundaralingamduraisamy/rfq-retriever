## 🧪 Testing Ideas
Try these conversational cases:

- *need rfq for steering components*
- *change delivery timeline to 3 weeks*
- *apply the recommended changes*
- *generate final structured rfq*
- *auto update dependent sections*
- *export as pdf*

---

## ⚠️ Known Constraints
- Only supports AUTOMOTIVE domain (by design)
- Requires internet for LLM responses
- Must not manually break formatting logic

---

## 🏁 Status
Actively Functional  
Used for real RFQ conversational automation  
Not a demo toy.
